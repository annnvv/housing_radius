<b>Hypothesis</b>: Average housing size (in square feet) increases as housing is farther away from the center of the Washington, DC (proxy Lincoln Memorial) and price roughly the same (or increases slightly, but probably does not decrease).

<b>Lessons Learned</b>:
1. Don't try to scrape zipcode data from websites (like Zillow which don't allow you to do so). Should have first merged all of the zipcode shapefiles together and gotten a list take way
2. Figure out how many zipcodes there are and what the zipcodes are before downloading housing data from each zip code (so when downloading data you get all of it, instead of just thinking you have all of it).
